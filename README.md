# sorting-algorithms

These are sorting algorithms in different programming languages.

This repository is focused on integer (32 bit) sorting algorithms to keep it simple.

I didn't copy-pasted any code from AI or websites. I wrote them myself. (Also I don't like using AI.)

Implemented languages (from fastest to slowest*): Java, C#, Python.

Implemented sorting algorithms (from fastest to slowest**): Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Bogo Sort.

*According to my tests when I use the fastest algorithm from my tests.

**According to my tests. (For Python implementations; Python's built in sorter, the sorted() function, is the fastest. Because it uses the C language and Powersort algorithm.)

TODO: Implementing more sorting algorithms and the C implementation (when I learn C)
