# sorting-algorithms

These are sorting algorithms in different programming languages.

This repository is focused on non-negative integer sorting algorithms to keep it simple. (Specifically, signed 32 bit integers but I only use the non-negative integers.)

Implemented sorting algorithms (from fastest to slowest*): Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort, Selection Sort, Insertsion Sort, Cocktail Shaker Sort, Gnome Sort, Bubble Sort, Sootage Sort, Bozo Sort, Bogo Sort.

Implemented languages (from fastest to slowest**): Java (25), C# (.Net 10), Python (3.14).

*According to my tests when I test with Java. (I didn't compare any language's built in sorter in this list.)

**According to my tests when I use Selection Sort. (I used VS Code for testing.)

You can analyze the code but please don't use this repository for cheating.

I DID NOT copy-pasted any code from any Generative AI (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) or any website. I wrote them myself. (But of course I get insprations from websites (for example geeksforgeeks) and videos (for example Bro Code and udiprod channels' videos). Also, I don't like using Generative AI and I don't recommend using it.)

The codes' file locations (use backward slashes if you use Windows file manager):

the Java code is in the MadeInJava/src/SortingAlgorithms.java file,

the C# code is in the MadeInC#/MadeInCSharp/SortingAlgorithms.cs file,

the Python code is in the made_in_python/sorting_algorithms.py file.

I didn't implemented the Bucket Sort algorithm because I wanted to use just arrays and not arraylists or linked lists.

I didn't implemented the Pigeonhole Sort algorithm because I don't want to come across memory problems due to making the array size very huge (like making the length as 2^31).

TODO:

Try to implement the Radix Sort algorithm and the Heap Sort algorithm.

Learn C in free time and implement the sorting algorithms in C.
