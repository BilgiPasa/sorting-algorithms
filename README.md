# sorting-algorithms

These are sorting algorithms in different programming languages.

This repository is focused on non-negative integer sorting algorithms to keep it simple. (Specifically, signed 32 bit integers but I only use the non-negative integers.)

Implemented sorting algorithms (from fastest to slowest*): Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort, Selection Sort, Insertsion Sort, Cocktail Shaker Sort, Gnome Sort, Bubble Sort, Sootage Sort, Bozo Sort, Bogo Sort.

Implemented languages (from fastest to slowest**): Java (25), C# (.Net 10), Python (3.14).

*According to my tests when I test with Java. (I didn't compare any language's built in sorter in this list.)

**According to my tests when I use Selection Sort. (I used VS Code for testing.)

You can analyze the code but please don't use this repository for cheating.

I DID NOT copy-pasted any code from any Generative AI (like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) or any website. I wrote them myself. (But of course I get insprations from websites (for example geeksforgeeks) and videos (for example Bro Code and udiprod channels' videos). Also, I don't like using Generative AI and I don't recommend using it.)

The code files' locations:

the Java files are in the MadeInJava/src folder,

the C# files are in the MadeInC#/MadeInCSharp folder,

the Python files are in the made_in_python folder.

(Use backward slashes if you use Windows file explorer.)

I'm not planning to implement the Pigeonhole Sort algorithm because I don't want to come across memory problems due to making the array size very huge (like making the length as 2^31).

I'm not planning to implement the Bucket Sort algorithm because I want to use just arrays in this repo. I don't want to use array lists or linked lists in this repo.

TODO:

* Change the Python code to use its built in lists. (I used the array module in the code.)

* Try to implement the Radix Sort and the Heap Sort algorithms.

* Learn C and implement the sorting algorithms in C.

* When you bored, find some more sorting algorithms and implement those too.
