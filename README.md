# sorting-algorithms

These are sorting algorithms in different programming languages.

This repository is focused on integer (32 bit) sorting algorithms to keep it simple.

Implemented sorting algorithms (from fastest to slowest*): Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort, Selection Sort, Insertsion Sort, Cocktail Shaker Sort, Gnome Sort, Bubble Sort, Sootage Sort, Bozo Sort, Bogo Sort.

Implemented languages (from fastest to slowest**): Java, C#, Python.

*According to my tests when I test with Java. (I didn't compare any language's built in sorter in this list.)

**According to my tests when I use Selection Sort. (I used VS Code for testing.)

You can analyze the code but please don't use this repository for cheating.

I didn't copy-pasted any code from any Generitive AI (like ChatGPT, Deepseek, Claude) or any website. I wrote them myself. (But of course I get insprations from websites (for example geeksforgeeks) and videos (for example Bro Code and udiprod channels' videos). Also, I don't like using Generitive AI.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The codes' file locations:

If we give an example from Selection Sort, (use backward slashes if you use Windows file manager)

the Java code is in the MadeInJava/src/SelectionSort.java file,

the C# code is in the MadeInC#/SelectionSort/SelectionSort/Program.cs file and

the Python code is in the made_in_python/selection_sort.py file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I didn't implemented the Counting Sort algorithm because it is meant for just numerals.

I didn't implemented the Radix Sort algorithm because it is meant for non-negative integers.

I didn't implemented the Bucket Sort algorithm because I wanted to use just arrays and not arraylists or linked lists.

I didn't implemented the Pigeonhole Sort algorithm because the maximum array size is limiting the algorithm when I want it to sort random integers (32 bit).
