# sorting-algorithms

These are sorting algorithms in different programming languages.

You can analyze the code and try to understand how these sorting algorithms work (or search up "how x sorting algorithm work" in Google). But you are prohibited to use this repository as a cheating device.

This repository is focused on integer (32 bit) sorting algorithms to keep it simple.

I didn't copy-pasted any code from AI or websites. I wrote them myself. (Also I don't like using AI.)

Implemented sorting algorithms (from fastest to slowest*): Selection Sort, Insertsion Sort, Bubble Sort, Bogo Sort.

Implemented languages (from fastest to slowest**): Java, C#, Python.

*According to my tests. (I didn't include any built in sorter to the list.)

**According to my tests when I use the fastest algorithm from my tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we give an example of Selection Sort, (use backward slashes if you use Windows file manager):

The C# code is in the MadeInC#/SelectionSort/SelectionSort/Program.cs file

The Java code is in the MadeInJava/src/SelectionSort.java file

The Python code is in the made_in_python/selection_sort.py file
