# sorting-algorithms

These are sorting algorithms in different programming languages.

This project is focused on integer (32 bit) sorting algorithms to keep it simple.

Implemented sorting algorithms (from fastest to slowest): Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Bogo Sort.

Implemented languages (from fastest to slowest): C#, Java, Python.

TODO: MergeSort, the C implementation (when I learn C)
