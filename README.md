# sorting-algorithms

These are sorting algorithms in different programming languages.

This repository is focused on non-negative integer sorting algorithms to keep it simple. (Specifically, signed 32 bit integers but I only use the non-negative integers.)

Implemented sorting algorithms (from fastest to slowest*): Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort, Insertsion Sort, Selection Sort, Gnome Sort, Cocktail Shaker Sort, Bubble Sort, Sootage Sort, Bozo Sort, Bogo Sort.

Implemented languages: C, C#, Java, Python.

C is implemented and mostly maintained by bartu-g. Thank you for contributing.

C#, Java and Python is implemented and mostly maintained by me (BilgiPasa).

Speed comparison of the languages (from fastest to slowest**): C (GCC 15), Java (25), C# (.Net 10), Python (3.14).

I wrote the code of the parts that I maintain myself. I did not vibe code. I learned these algorithms from websites (for example geeksforgeeks) and videos (for example Bro Code and udiprod channels' videos).

*According to my tests when I test with C#. (If you compare the sorting algorithms' speed in different languages, you might get a different result. For example, when I test with Java, Selection Sort was faster than Insertsion Sort but in C, C# and Python, Insertsion Sort was faster than Selection Sort. Also, I didn't compare any language's built-in sorter in this list.)

**According to my tests when I use Insertsion Sort. (I used VS Code for testing. I compiled and ran the C files using the commands that has written in the made_in_c/README.md file. If you test yourself, you might get a different result.)

The code files' locations:

The C files are in the made_in_c folder.

The C# files are in the MadeInC#/MadeInCSharp folder.

The Java files are in the MadeInJava/src folder.

The Python files are in the made_in_python folder.

(Use backward slashes if you are using the Windows file explorer.)
