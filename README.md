# sorting-algorithms

These are sorting algorithms in different programming languages.

This project is focused on integer (32 bit) sorting algorithms to keep it simple.

Implemented sorting algorithms (from fastest to slowest*): Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Bogo Sort.

Implemented languages (from fastest to slowest**): C#, Java, Python.

*According to my tests

**According to my tests when use the fastest algorithm from my tests. The fastest language may change for other algorithms. (For your information, Python's sorted() is not the fastest.)

TODO: Merge Sort, the C implementation (when I learn C)
