Use this command to compile the C code:
    gcc -std=c23 -O3 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -o main main.c sorting_algorithms.c -lm

Use this command to run the C code:
    ./main

I (BilgiPasa) use GCC to run the C code.

The execatable named "main" can be run if you have a computer that has an x86 CPU. If you have an ARM or RISC-V
CPU, compile the main executable yourself.
